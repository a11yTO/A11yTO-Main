<p><strong>#a11yTO</strong> actively promotes digital inclusion for the design and development communities in and around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We welcome people of all abilities and experience - from people curious about what this accessibility thing is all about to experts in the field.</p>

<p><strong>#a11yTO</strong> holds regular <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11yTO/">Meetups</a>, an annual <a href="https://camp.a11yto.com/">Camp</a>, and Conferences too! 2019 brings the addition of <a href="http://irl.a11yto.com/"><strong>#a11yIRL</strong></a>, focused specifically on the accessibility of the built environment, and <a href="http://gaming.a11yto.com/"><strong>#a11yTO</strong> Gaming</a>, an event dedicated to accessible gaming. We'd love to meet you at our next event!
