<p>As you know, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is volunteer-run and we can’t do it without you.</p>
<p>We’re looking for people to help out in a variety of ways, from on-site set up and tear down, AV, registration desk, and helping attendees and speakers at events, through to graphic design, web site, video production, and marketing and communications. A lot of our opportunities are in-person and on-site, but not all.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, use the link below to go to our "Volunteer Application" to tell us a little bit about yourself, your interest and availability. We’ll be in touch as opportunities arise. </p>
