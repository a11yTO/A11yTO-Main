<h2 class="page-title">#a11yWeekTO</h2>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO</strong> Team is thrilled to announce that <strong>#a11yWeekTO</strong> is going to be 100% virtual this year!</p>
<p>Our week-long event features: <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> (our digital accessibility conference), <strong>#a11yIRL</strong> (our Accessibility in Real Life event), and <strong>#a11yTO Gaming</strong> (our accessible gaming conference).</p>
<p>Toronto has depth and diversity within our accessibility community. While we canâ€™t all be together in person this year, we are still committed to showcasing what our community has to offer. Last year we welcomed hundreds of speakers and attendees from all over the world.</p>
