<h2 class="page-title">#a11yWeekTO</h2>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO</strong> Team is thrilled to announce that <strong>#a11yWeekTO</strong> is going to be 100% virtual this year!</p>
<p>This week-long celebration of accessibility features: <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> (our digital accessibility conference), <strong>#a11yIRL</strong> (Accessibility In Real Life), and <strong>#a11yTO Gaming</strong> (our accessible gaming conference).</p>
<p>Toronto has depth and diversity within our accessibility community. While we canâ€™t all be together in person this year, we are still committed to showcasing what our community has to offer. Last year we welcomed hundreds of speakers and attendees from all over the world.</p>
<p>We look forward to doing it all again in October 2020!</p>
<p>These are a few changes to our program this year.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>#a11yIRL</strong> - will be a free evening event on Tuesday, October 20th;</li>
  <li><strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> - will be a shortened daily schedule over three days from Wednesday, October 21st to Friday, October 23rd;</li>
  <li><strong>#a11yTO Gaming</strong> - will be on Saturday, October 24th</li>
</ul>

<p>Our call for presentations for all events is open now! Please submit your talk ideas. We will be reviewing submissions soon and will reach out to you in August.</p>
