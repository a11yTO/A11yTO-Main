<h2 class="page-title">#a11yTO 2022</h2> 
<p>Hi all! It’s been a while since we provided an update, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t been busy behind the scenes, planning awesome events for 2022! We have a lot to share so let’s jump right in!</p>

<h3>#a11yTO Camp</h3>
<p>We are currently scouting locations for <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong>. As you can imagine, with things starting to open back up, it’s been a little difficult to secure a venue but fear not, we’ll get that sorted out in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’d like to share some information about an exciting format change to <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong>. Starting this year, we’re going back to our roots and running <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> as a traditional BarCamp with a single track, shorter talks, and lots of opportunities to engage with the community.</p>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO Camp</strong> call for presentations will open shortly and you’ll get your chance to vote for the talks that interest you. Stay tuned for more info!</p>

<h3>Meetups</h3>
<p>Our meetups will return soon. Meetups will likely continue to be virtual for the time being, but we are exploring opportunities to run hybrid or in-person events once it’s warmer outside.</p>

<h3>#a11yWeekTO</h3>
<p><strong>#a11yWeekTO</strong> will be in person in 2022!! We will adhere to public health protocols at all our events for the health and safety or our attendees, volunteers and organizers. Venue information will be finalized soon. You can expect that our events will be held in downtown Toronto over the week of October 17-22. Tickets will go on sale in May.</p>

<h4 class="sub-head">#a11yTO Conf</h4>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> will run on October 20th and 21st. As we promised last year, this Conf will be a hybrid event allowing for either in-person and remote attendance. The call for presentations is open so start working on those talk ideas!</p>
